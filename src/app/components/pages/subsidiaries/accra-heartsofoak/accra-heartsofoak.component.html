                <p>Accra Hearts of Oak is a Ghanaian football club based in Accra, the capital of Ghana. The club was
                    founded on November 11, 1911 by a group of young men led by Christopher Brandford Nettey, a leader
                    of the Ga State in the colonial times.</p>

                <p>The club has worked hard to earn the reputation as one of the
                    biggest clubs in the country and as also the premier club in the city of Accra.</p>

                <p>Hearts of Oak won their first major match in 1922 when Sir Gordon Guggisberg, governor of the Gold
                    Coast, founded the Accra Football League. Hearts won 6 out of 12 seasons in this league. In 1956,
                    Hearts joined the Ghanaian football league and have flourished since.
                    In the year 2000, Hearts of Oak won the Ghana FA cup, the Ghana Premier League and for the first
                    time in their history the CAF Champions League. This was the most successful year in the Clubs'
                    history.</p>
